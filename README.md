# car_purchase_prediction
Predicting the influence of social media ads on car purchase using logistic regression.

Here, we will be using data of individuals such as Age, Gender , Salary etc..to analyze and predict the chances of customers buying a car based on watching social media ads. 

Logistic Regression is being used here as the predicted values are 0s(Did not buy a car) and 1s(Bought a car).

We have checked cleansed the dataset with all type of impurities and even visualized the features for better clarity and removing Multicollinearity. 

Statsmodel and RFE have been used to check for p-values & multicollinearity. 

All steps are explained inside the notebook. 

Happy Learning!
